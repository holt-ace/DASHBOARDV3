## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive implementation plan for transforming the Purchase Order (PO) Management System's frontend. We will focus on three key innovations that will revolutionize how users interact with the system:

1. **Dynamic Purchase Order Lifecycle Experience** - Transform the static form-based PO editing into an interactive, visual, and contextual experience that adapts to each stage of the PO lifecycle.

2. **Multi-dimensional Planning & Visualization Hub** - Create a versatile interface for visualizing POs in multiple contexts (calendar, kanban, timeline, map) to enable better planning and management.

3. **Intelligent Metrics & Analytics Dashboard** - Develop a comprehensive analytics dashboard that leverages the backend metrics API to provide actionable business intelligence.

This plan serves as a detailed roadmap to keep the implementation team on track throughout the development process.

## Core Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

We will implement a modern component-based architecture using React with the following structure:

```
src/
├── components/            # Reusable UI components
│   ├── status-workflow/   # Status workflow components
│   ├── action-panels/     # Contextual action panels
│   ├── visualizations/    # Visualization components
│   ├── metrics/           # Metrics and analytics components
│   └── common/            # Common UI components
├── pages/                 # Page components
├── services/              # API and business logic services
├── hooks/                 # Custom React hooks
├── utils/                 # Utility functions
├── store/                 # State management
├── context/               # React context providers
└── assets/                # Static assets
```

### State Management

We'll use Redux Toolkit for global state management with the following structure:

```javascript
// Store shape
{
  poList: {
    items: [],
    filteredItems: [],
    loading: false,
    error: null,
    pagination: { page: 1, totalPages: 1, totalItems: 0 }
  },
  poDetail: {
    data: null,
    statusTransitions: [],
    requirements: {},
    loading: false,
    error: null
  },
  visualization: {
    mode: 'list', // 'list', 'calendar', 'kanban', 'timeline', 'map'
    filters: {},
    selectedItems: []
  },
  metrics: {
    summary: {},
    trends: {},
    statusDistribution: {},
    loading: false,
    error: null
  },
  ui: {
    sidebarOpen: true,
    activeTab: 'details',
    notifications: []
  }
}
```
